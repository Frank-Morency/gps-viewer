***I HAVE A LOT MORE TODO ON THIS, WORKING ON IT AS TIME PERMIT***
***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK***

FOR  NOW IT COULD ONLY PRINT ON SCREEN RAW DATA AND IT COULD BE PIPED TO FILE
SELECTION FROM COMMAND LINE AND WITHIN EXECUTION WORK

Open /dev/ttyUSB0
Configure port speed to 4800 bauds
Read nema sentences and print them on screen (could also be piped to a file) 

/*if you want to pipe all sentence:
exemple: ./prog_name ALL > your_file.txt
only one type of sentence run it as in:
exemple: ./prog_name \$GPGGA > your_file.txt
this will only take $GPGGA sentence on pipe.

If you dont put any argument you have to select at runtime*/
